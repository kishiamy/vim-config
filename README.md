# What's this?

This is my personal tmux config, I use it in my "personal/virtual" machines.

# How I can install this config?

```bash
wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groteck/vim-config/master/install.sh | bash
```
# How I can delete this config?

```bash
rm -rf ~/.vim*
```
# How does it look?
